# Description
This project was designed to utilize inquirer prompts to dynamically create an html file, which displays the content along with some stylized cards. The other part of this project was to run tests to confirm they sit is functioning properly. 

## Installation
The first part of the process was reading the documentation and creating all the files I would be using. Then I decided to create my html and css that I would use to create the site. From their I built out my inquirer prompts. I built additional functions to choose what to do depending on what the user choose. Then I had to set up the html to be dynamically created based on these decisions. Finally, I set up all the employee java script and test files. 

### Usage
This site was a great exercise on using all the skills I have learned to bring together a dynamic website. I believe something like this is super beneficial when you have the steps down, because you can easily recreate websites with new information. 

#### Credits
I credit the good class material to help me with this project. I also used askbcs and tutoring to fine tune a few parts.
